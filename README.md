# Spaceship Titanic – Passenger Transport Prediction

## Overview
In the year **2912**, the interstellar passenger liner **Spaceship Titanic** collided with a **spacetime anomaly** while traveling to the habitable exoplanet *55 Cancri E*.  
Almost half of the 13,000 passengers were transported to an alternate dimension.
