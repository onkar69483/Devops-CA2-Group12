## Problem Statement
The objective of this Kaggle competition is to predict whether a person is an **Introvert** or an **Extrovert**, given their social behavior and personality traits. This is a **binary classification task** where the model learns from labeled training data and generalizes to predict unseen test data.

## Files Overview
| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `train.csv` | Personality and social behavior data with known labels (Introvert/Extrovert) |
| `test.csv` | Data without labels (prediction required) |
| `sample_submission.csv` | Submission template provided by Kaggle |
| `submission.csv` | Final predictions generated by our model (submitted to Kaggle) |
| `extrointro.ipynb` | Jupyter Notebook with data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation |

## Approach

### Data Preprocessing
- Handled missing values using median/mode imputation
- Normalized continuous features for consistent scaling
- Encoded categorical variables into numerical form
- Feature engineering to capture additional behavioral insights

### Model
- Used **Ensemble Models (Random Forest & Gradient Boosting)** as core classifiers
- Hyperparameter tuning via GridSearchCV
- Applied **train-test split** for validation and cross-validation for robust evaluation

### Validation
- Split dataset into **80/20 train-validation**
- Used **accuracy score** and **F1-score** to evaluate performance on validation set

## Results

| Metric | Score |
|--------|-------|
| **Public Leaderboard Accuracy** | **0.971659** |
| **Private Leaderboard Accuracy** | **0.968421** |

The model performed consistently well on both **public** and **private leaderboards**, achieving ~97% accuracy overall.

## Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates how social and personality trait data can be leveraged for binary classification. The achieved accuracy highlights the effectiveness of ensemble learning methods for structured classification tasks.
